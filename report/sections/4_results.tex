\section{Results}

This section presents the empirical findings from the 10 independent runs of each optimizer on the three models (DT, KNN, CNN).

\subsection{RQ1: Effectiveness and Convergence}

All optimizers improved solutions over 50 evaluations, but convergence efficiency varied by model (Figure \ref{fig:convergence}). For DT and KNN, which have relatively small search spaces, GA, PSO, and RS converged rapidly to near-identical optimal configurations. Their final fitness scores were approximately 0.3384 and 0.4308, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:test_perf}).

\end{figure}

For the more complex CNN, GA showed steady improvement from a lower initial fitness, while RS occasionally found high-fitness configurations early (Figure \ref{fig:convergence}). All optimizers converged to a similar final performance of approximately 0.77 (Figure \ref{fig:test_perf}).

\subsection{RQ2: Stability}

The stability of final solutions, shown by box plots of fitness across 10 runs (Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}), was high for all models. Variance was minimal for DT and KNN. For CNN, all optimizers produced similar inter-quartile ranges (approximately 0.79 to 0.83), with minor differences in outlier counts (GA: 1, PSO: 2, RS: 1).

\subsection{Statistical Significance}

Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed no significant performance differences between any optimizer pairs across all models ($p > 0.05$; Table \ref{tab:wilcoxon}). The nearest to significance was PSO versus RS on KNN (p = 0.094). The memetic GA variant also showed no statistically significant improvement over the standard GA.
