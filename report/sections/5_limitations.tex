\section{Limitations}

\paragraph{Insufficient Evolutionary Iterations.} The primary threat to validity is the interaction between the population size ($P=30$) and the fixed evaluation budget ($B=50$). This ratio mathematically restricted the Genetic Algorithm to fewer than two full generations ($N_{gen} \approx 1.67$). Consequently, 60\% of the computational budget was consumed by the random initialization phase (Generation 0), leaving insufficient iterations for the metaheuristic mechanisms (crossover, mutation, and selection) to drive convergence away from the initial random distribution.

\paragraph{Statistical Power.} The experiment utilized $N=10$ independent runs per optimizer-model pair. While standard for exploratory HPO studies, this sample size limits the statistical power of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, potentially masking small but consistent effect sizes between the algorithms.

\paragraph{Scope Validity.} The evaluation was restricted to grayscale CIFAR-10 and fixed hyperparameter search spaces. These results may not generalize to higher-dimensional search spaces (e.g., full RGB imagery or deeper architectures) where the "curse of dimensionality" might differentiate global search strategies (GA) from local ones (PSO) more effectively.
